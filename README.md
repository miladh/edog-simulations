# edog-simulations

This repository contains all simulations presented in the paper:

"Firing-Rate Based Network Modeling of the dLGN Circuit: Effects of Cortical Feedback on Spatiotemporal Response Properties of Relay Cells".

These simulations use the [pyLGN simulator](http://pylgn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the calculations are done in Jupyter notebooks.

## Installation

- Install [pyLGN](http://pylgn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installation).
- Clone or download this repo.
- In terminal run `python setup.py`
